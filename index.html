              <p>
                Brazil team was a very good competitor in the Copa America,2021. They have some promising players who all were very good in the tournament. But the team faced the disaster against Argentina.A COVID-19 debate and a scandal in their football association impacted Brazil during the Copa America. As a result, the Selecao end the tournament empty-handed.The main storyline of the Copa America final was easy to recognize. Argentina ended their title drought with a 1-0 win over Brazil in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.The only goal scorer was Angel Di Maria, who scored with a lovely chip in the 22nd minute. It was the first major title for superstar Lionel Messi with the Argentine national team."It was not an attractive final.

                Lionel Messi finally ticked the last empty box in his glittering soccer career on Saturday night, leading Argentina past host Brazil, 1-0, in the final of the Copa América in Rio de Janeiro.
                The trophy was Messi’s first with Argentina after a string of painful, agonizing, maddening failures, including perhaps the most demoralizing defeat of his career — against Germany in the World Cup final — inside the same stadium, Rio’s hulking Maracanã, in 2014.When the whistle blew to end the final, Messi — his relief palpable — dropped to his knees and was immediately surrounded by his teammates. Moments later, they were lifting him above their shoulders and tossing him in the air.When the whistle blew to end the final, Messi — his relief palpable — dropped to his knees and was immediately surrounded by his teammates.

              <p>
                Argentina won their first major title in 28 years on Saturday when an Angel Di Maria goal gave them a 1-0 win over Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America.
                Di Maria got the winner midway through the first half when he lobbed Ederson after full back Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long through ball.
                Argentina’s win was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked up his first ever title in a blue and white shirt after more than a decade of club and individual honours.
                Messi, who missed a golden chance to score with two minutes remaining, finished the tournament’s joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected joint best player along with Neymar.Tears of joy from the men in sky blue and white as the small group of Argentina fans celebrate.

                Fede Valverde and Uruguay couldn’t progress past Colombia in the Copa America quarter finals, falling 4-2 on penalties after a chaotic and entertaining 90 minutes.

                Valverde once again started in now familiar wide position alongside Bentancur and Arracesta. His first half was quiet, however, the match itself was anything but. A combination of bad finishing and bad defending offered a host of chances for both sides in the first 45, the best being a cut back to Edison Cavani in the box whom, after passing the keeper, fired the ball into the side netting.
                
                Valverde had three big involvements in the match in the first 10 minutes of the second half. He created two half chances for Uruguay, one a cross that tricked Ospina and the other a cut back.

                Di Maria, starting for just the second time in the Copa, justified his selection by scoring the opener midway through the first half.
                Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long ball forward from Rodrigo De Paul and Di Maria lobbed the stranded Ederson with aplomb.Brazil piled on the pressure in an exciting second half but even with five strikers on the field they could not get an equalizer against an Argentine defense protected by the outstanding Rodrigo De Paul.
                "First we have to congratulate our opponents especially for the first half when they neutralized us," said Brazilian defender Thiago Silva.
